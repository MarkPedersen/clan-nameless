<p class="lead">We have in our clan always appreciated to communicate while we play games with each other, we here in the clan uses two different programs to communicate with each other (oral). The program we have used for the most time and so far have highly appreciated is teamspeak, teamspeak is one of the oldest communication programs built for multiple players. Our team speak server address is 85.236.107.37:11237. The password can only be obtained directly from another member, over either steam or battlenet.</p>
<a href="https://www.teamspeak.com/downloads"><img src="app/shared/img/teamspeak_small.png" style="width:200px; height:105px;"></a>
<p class="lead">We have more recently explored other options than teamspeak as teamspeak have monthly costs. we have so far in our quest found
an upcoming program called Discord, Discord is built on the same principles as Teamspeak and we have so far not experienced problems
with application performance and if this continue, we will over the next few months move all our oral communication to Discord.
Discord function so that you have to receive a (one time) invitation over the program to join our server.</p>
